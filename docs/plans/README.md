# Plans index

The map of planning docs across the repo. **Engine plans** live here (`docs/plans/NNN-*.md`, numbered); the
**offline tools** keep their own `docs/plans/` next to their code. Open questions and parked ideas live in
[`../open-issues/`](../open-issues/) and [`../ideas/`](../ideas/).

> The [Nx monorepo migration (plan 057)](./057-nx-monorepo-migration.md) will move each tool's `docs/` under
> `tools/<name>/docs/` — update the links below when it lands.

## Engine (`docs/plans/`)

Core runtime + RenderWare parsing, world streaming, rendering, characters, vehicles, physics, UI — plans
`001`–`057`. Newest first:

- [057 — Nx monorepo migration](./057-nx-monorepo-migration.md)
- [056 — Multi-game config](./056-multi-game-config.md)
- [055 — Input sources / mobile controls](./055-input-sources-mobile-controls.md) · [054 — Asset cache revoke](./054-asset-cache-revoke.md) · [053 — Asset local loader](./053-asset-local-loader.md)
- …`001`–`052` in this folder.

## Tools (each ships its own plans)

- **map-optimizer** — lossless DFF/TXD conditioning (normals, prelit, dedupe, mips, full build).
  [`map-optimizer/docs/plans/`](../../tools/map-optimizer/docs/plans/) (`001`–`015`).
- **vehicle-optimizer** — scale + reflection-strength transfer for vehicle DFFs.
  [`vehicle-optimizer/docs/plans/`](../../tools/vehicle-optimizer/docs/plans/) (`001`–`003`).
- **lod-generator** — chunked LOD bake (merge → QEM decimate → per-cell TXD → drop-in build).
  [`lod-generator/docs/plans/`](../../tools/lod-generator/docs/plans/) (`001`–`002`).
- **tool-kit** — shared building blocks (mesh smooth-normals + QEM simplify, editable IMG). No plans doc yet.
- **rw-codec** — shared pure RW chunk/DFF/DXT/geometry-struct codec, extracted from map-optimizer (plan 057,
  step 2). Top-level `rw-codec/` now; moves under `tools/` in the migration. No plans doc.
- **timecyc-builder** — timecyc precompute. No plans doc yet.

## Other docs

- [`../open-issues/`](../open-issues/) — investigated problems kept for reference (e.g. locked-dff).
- [`../ideas/`](../ideas/) — parked design directions ("later, maybe").
- [`../architecture.md`](../architecture.md) — high-level engine architecture.
